# A TLS front for the lab, so the TLS client can be measured against a real
# handshake with real certificate verification.
#
# # Why a proxy rather than turning Headscale's own TLS on
#
# Headscale serves one scheme at a time, so switching it to HTTPS would take
# every other check offline — and those checks are the reason the suite is worth
# anything. A terminating proxy on a second port leaves plain HTTP where it was
# and adds TLS beside it, which is also closer to how the hosted service is
# actually reached: TLS is a layer over the same protocol, not a different one.
#
# # Why ECDSA
#
# `embedded-tls`'s certificate verifier is allocation-free for ECDSA chains. Its
# RSA support pulls in `alloc`, which this project does not have, and
# controlplane.tailscale.com serves an RSA-PSS-only chain. So a local ECDSA chain
# is what can be verified honestly today; the hosted service needs an
# allocation-free RSA verifier that does not yet exist here, and the check says
# so rather than implying otherwise.
#
#   tests/lab/tls.sh up      # generate a CA and certificate, start the proxy
#   tests/lab/tls.sh down
