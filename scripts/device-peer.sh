# Configure this machine as the WireGuard peer of a flashed gateway, and prove
# the tunnel works.
#
# The gateway is responder-only: it never starts a handshake, so the initiator
# has to be something that can. Kernel WireGuard is that something. This is the
# hardware form of the test `scripts/interop-wireguard.sh` runs against the
# `responder` example and the harness — same protocol, same peer, real radio.
#
# The interface is created in the host namespace rather than a network
# namespace, which is safe only because `AllowedIPs` is a single /32 and adds
# one host route. When M3 widens it to 0.0.0.0/0 to test exit-node forwarding,
# this must move into a namespace or it will capture all of this machine's
# traffic.
