# Milestone M2, verified against the reference implementation.
#
# Stands up a real kernel WireGuard interface inside a network namespace and
# points it at the `responder` example, which runs our `wg-core` on the host.
# The kernel initiates, our code responds, and an in-tunnel ping proves the
# whole path: handshake, transport keys, replay window, and encapsulation.
#
# A namespace is used so the test cannot disturb the machine's own routing, and
# so `AllowedIPs` can later widen to 0.0.0.0/0 for the M3 NAT work without
# cutting the developer's connectivity.
#
# Requires root (network namespaces and WireGuard interfaces both do).
#
# Three modes. The first two are responders, and must behave identically
# because both are the same `wg-core`. The third reverses the roles: our code
# starts the handshake and the kernel answers, which is what a Tailscale node
# does to its peers.
#
