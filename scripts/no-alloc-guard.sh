# Fails if the no-allocation rule has been broken.
#
# The rule is easy to state and easy to lose: no code in this repository may
# allocate, because the ESP32-C6 has no heap configured and the whole design
# depends on every buffer being accounted for. It is also easy to break by
# accident — one `Vec` in a dependency's default features is enough — and the
# resulting failure is a linker error on the device, long after the commit that
# caused it.
#
# Two mechanisms, because neither alone is sufficient.
#
#   1. A grep over our own sources. Catches the direct mistake.
#   2. Building the harness. This is the real guard: `x86_64-unknown-linux-none`
#      with `build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins"]` has no `alloc` crate at
#      all, so a dependency that needs one cannot link. It fails at build time
#      rather than on hardware.
#
# `crates/ts-conformance` is exempt: it is `publish = false`, `std`, and exists
# to measure the others.
