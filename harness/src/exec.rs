//! A single-threaded executor whose only blocking primitive is `poll`.
//!
//! # Why not `embassy-executor`
//!
//! Its `platform-spin` backend busy-polls, which would make a soak test measure
//! the executor rather than the tunnel, and it has an unresolved linker problem
//! on bare `x86_64`. But the deeper reason is that there is nothing here for a
//! general executor to do. Every library crate in this project is sans-io: each
//! reports what it wants to send and when it next wants to be woken, and never
//! blocks. That leaves exactly one question to answer in the whole program —
//! "sleep until one of these descriptors is ready or this deadline passes" —
//! which is one syscall.
//!
//! So this is a reactor with just enough executor around it to drive futures.
//! The library crates stay executor-agnostic; only this file knows about `poll`,
//! and an Embassy build would replace it without touching anything else.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`block_on`] drives one top-level future. When that future returns `Pending`
//! it has, by construction, registered at least one wakeup source with the
//! [`Reactor`] — a descriptor, a deadline, or both — and `block_on` sleeps on
//! exactly those. Wakers are inert: after any wait the top-level future is
//! polled again unconditionally, so there is no wakeup to lose and no need for
//! the atomics a multi-threaded executor would require.
