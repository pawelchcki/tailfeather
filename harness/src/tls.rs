//! TLS 1.3, with the certificate chain actually verified.
//!
//! # Why this is worth being careful about
//!
//! A TLS client that negotiates a session but does not check who it is talking
//! to is worse than no TLS at all: it costs the same and provides confidence it
//! has not earned. So this wires `embedded-tls`'s `rustpki` verifier in
//! properly, against a pinned trust anchor, with hostname checking and a real
//! clock so an expired certificate is refused.
//!
//! # ECDSA only, and that is a real limitation
//!
//! `embedded-tls`'s verifier is allocation-free for ECDSA chains. Its RSA
//! support pulls in `alloc`, which this project does not have —
//! `rsa = ["dep:rsa", "rustpki", "alloc"]` in its own manifest. And
//! `controlplane.tailscale.com` serves an RSA-PSS-only chain.
//!
//! So this verifies a real chain against a real TLS 1.3 server, and it cannot
//! yet talk to the hosted Tailscale service. The conformance check says exactly
//! that rather than implying the harder half is done.
