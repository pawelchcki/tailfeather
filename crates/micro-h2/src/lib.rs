//! A minimal HTTP/2 client: `no_std`, allocation-free, sans-io.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Enough HTTP/2 to be a client and no more. No server, no push, no priority,
//! no trailers, and a small fixed number of concurrent streams. That is not
//! laziness — HTTP/2's full surface is large, and every feature carried is
//! another piece of state that has to be right. What this omits, it omits
//! explicitly, and refuses rather than half-implements.
//!
//! # What is genuinely hard here
//!
//! Two things, and both fail silently rather than loudly:
//!
//! **HPACK's dynamic table is connection state built from the peer's stream.**
//! Skipping an insertion does not lose a header; it shifts every subsequent
//! index, so later headers decode as *different headers*. See [`hpack::dynamic`].
//!
//! **Flow control is not optional.** A receiver starts with a 65535-byte window
//! per stream and per connection, and a sender that has exhausted it simply
//! stops. A long-poll streaming a netmap will deliver exactly 65535 bytes and
//! then hang, which looks like a server fault and is not. See [`conn`].
//!
//! # Sans-io
//!
//! [`conn::Connection`] never touches a socket. It is fed the bytes that arrived
//! and writes the bytes to send, so the same code runs over TCP, over a ts2021
//! Noise channel, and over a captured session in a test.
