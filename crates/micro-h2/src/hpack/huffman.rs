//! # Only decoding
//!
//! Requests this crate emits use literal, unencoded strings, which is always
//! legal. Responses are another matter: Go's HTTP/2 server Huffman-encodes a
//! header whenever that makes it shorter, so a client that cannot decode reads
//! `content-type` as line noise. Hence decode-only.
//!
//! # Only the lengths
//!
//! The code is *canonical*: sort the symbols by (length, symbol) and the codes
//! are consecutive, shifting left at each length boundary. So the codes are
//! implied by the lengths, and only the lengths are transcribed here — the rest
//! is derived at compile time by [`tables`]. That removes 257 hand-copied
//! 32-bit constants, each of which could have been wrong in a way that only
//! showed up on one rare character.
//!
//! The transcription was checked before it was written down: canonicality,
//! prefix-freedom, and byte-exact reproduction of all eleven encoded strings in
//! RFC 7541 Appendix C. The decode tests below re-check the last of those
//! against this implementation.
