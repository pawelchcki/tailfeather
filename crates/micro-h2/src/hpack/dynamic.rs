//! The HPACK dynamic table.
//!
//! # Why this cannot be skipped
//!
//! It is tempting to ignore: a client could decline to *use* the dynamic table
//! in the headers it sends, and never add an entry of its own. But the table is
//! shared state built from the peer's stream, and the peer decides what goes in
//! it. Every "literal with incremental indexing" the server sends inserts an
//! entry, and every later reference is an index into a table that only exists if
//! we kept it.
//!
//! Skipping an insertion does not produce a missing header — it shifts every
//! subsequent index by one, so headers decode as *other headers*, plausibly and
//! silently, for the rest of the connection. That is why decoding an unknown
//! index is an error here rather than a best-effort guess.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A ring of fixed capacity. Entry 62 is the newest, and inserting evicts from
//! the far end — which is the opposite of what a naive `Vec` push does, and the
//! reason indices are computed rather than stored.
