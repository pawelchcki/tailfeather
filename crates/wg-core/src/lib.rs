//! A sans-io WireGuard core: `no_std`, allocation-free, and independent of any
//! particular socket API.
//!
//! # Sans-io
//!
//! [`Device`] never touches a socket, a clock, or a random number generator of
//! its own. Callers hand it received datagrams along with the current time and
//! a source of randomness, and it hands back [`Action`]s describing what should
//! be sent or delivered. That is what lets the identical code run inside an
//! Embassy task on an ESP32-C6 and under `cargo test` on a laptop.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Both handshake roles are implemented. A peer is a pure responder until
//! [`Device::set_initiating`] is called for it, which is what a point-to-point
//! tunnel wants; a mesh node marks its peers as initiating and lets
//! [`Device::poll_handshakes`] drive rekeys.
//!
//! The cookie/`mac2` denial-of-service mechanism is not implemented; a
//! device-wide token bucket over handshake work stands in for it. Replay
//! protection *is* implemented in full.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use wg_core::{Device, Action, Instant, Rng};
//!
//! # struct Zeros;
//! # impl Rng for Zeros { fn fill_bytes(&mut self, dest: &mut [u8]) { dest.fill(7) } }
//! # let mut rng = Zeros;
//! let mut device: Device<4> = Device::new([0x42; 32]);
//! let peer = device.add_peer([0x11; 32], None).unwrap();
//!
//! let mut out = [0u8; wg_core::MAX_DATAGRAM_LEN];
//! match device.poll_timers(Instant(0), &mut out) {
//!     Action::None => {}                       // nothing due yet
//!     Action::Send { peer, data } => { let _ = (peer, data); }
//!     Action::Receive { .. } => unreachable!(), // timers never deliver
//! }
//! ```
