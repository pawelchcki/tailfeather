//! The Noise IKpsk2 handshake, both roles.
//!
//! The functions here follow the WireGuard paper's notation line for line.
//!
//! The responder half is split in two because the middle of the handshake is
//! where we first learn *who* is talking to us: the initiator's static public
//! key arrives encrypted, and only once it is decrypted can we look up that
//! peer's pre-shared key and finish the exchange. [`consume_initiation`] runs up
//! to that point; [`create_response`] takes it from there.
//!
//! The initiator half is split for a different reason: [`create_initiation`]
//! leaves behind a [`Handshake`] holding the ephemeral key and the chaining
//! state, which [`consume_response`] needs and which must survive the round trip
//! over the network. Both halves walk the same ladder in the same order, so a
//! mistake in one is visible as disagreement with the other.
