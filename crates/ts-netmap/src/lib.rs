//! The network map: who else is on the tailnet, and how to reach them.
//!
//! # Streaming, not buffering
//!
//! A `MapResponse` for a two-node lab is 27 KB. A real tailnet's is megabytes,
//! and the connection carrying it is a long poll that never ends — so there is
//! no "the document" to hold, only a stream of them. Nothing here ever has more
//! than one JSON token and one peer under construction in hand, whatever the
//! size of what is arriving.
//!
//! That is the whole reason this is a push parser rather than a `serde` model:
//! the shape of the API is what enforces the property. A parser that returned a
//! `MapResponse` would have had to build one.
//!
//! # Deltas
//!
//! The first response is a full map; almost everything after it is a delta, and
//! the capture bears that out — five of eleven captured responses carry only
//! changes. Deltas *omit* fields rather than repeating them, so treating each
//! response as a full map silently discards every peer it did not mention. The
//! three forms are handled separately:
//!
//! - `PeersChanged` — whole peer records to insert or replace
//! - `PeersChangedPatch` — named fields of an existing peer, and nothing else
//! - `PeersRemoved` — node ids to forget
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Fields a headless node acts on: identity, addresses, endpoints, and the DERP
//! map. `Hostinfo`, `UserProfiles`, `PacketFilters` and `DNSConfig` are skipped
//! wholesale rather than parsed into something nothing reads.
