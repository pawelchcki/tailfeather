//! Splitting a long-poll stream into MapResponses.
//!
//! The body is `[4-byte length][JSON]` repeated for as long as the connection
//! lives. The length is **little-endian**, unlike every other length in this
//! protocol; reading it big-endian yields a number in the hundreds of millions,
//! which looks like a corrupt stream rather than like a byte-order mistake.
//!
//! HTTP/2 `DATA` frames have nothing to do with these boundaries: one map
//! response routinely spans several, and one frame can hold the end of one
//! response and the start of the next. This reader is what absorbs that, and it
//! is deliberately the only place that buffers — it holds a length prefix and
//! whatever partial one has arrived, never a whole response.
