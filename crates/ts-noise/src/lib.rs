//! The Tailscale control-plane transport, known upstream as ts2021.
//!
//! A TCP connection carrying a Noise IK handshake, then a record layer, and
//! HTTP/2 inside that. This crate covers everything below the HTTP/2: the
//! bootstrap over HTTP/1.1, the handshake, the framing, and the early payload
//! the server sends before its HTTP/2 preface.
//!
//! # Sans-io
//!
//! Nothing here touches a socket. Functions take the bytes that arrived and
//! write the bytes to send, so the same code runs under `cargo test` on the
//! host, on the harness's reactor, and later on embassy-net. It also means the
//! whole protocol can be replayed against a captured session.
//!
//! # Where the constants come from
//!
//! Every byte-level constant in this crate was read out of
//! `tests/vectors/ts2021-session.pcap` — a real tailscaled 1.94.2 registering
//! with a real Headscale v0.29.3 — not from documentation. Each is commented
//! with what the capture showed. The one that matters most is in [`record`]:
//! the record nonce counter is **big-endian**, where WireGuard's is
//! little-endian, and the two agree at counter zero. An implementation that
//! gets this wrong completes the handshake, exchanges one correct record, and
//! then fails.
