//! The early payload the server may send before its HTTP/2 preface.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! Once the Noise handshake completes, the *decrypted* stream from the server
//! either begins with an HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame, or with a short out-of-band
//! message that HTTP/2 knows nothing about. The message carries a node-key
//! challenge, which registration needs before any HTTP/2 request is made.
//!
//! ```text
//! ff ff ff 'T' 'S'   5-byte magic
//! xx xx xx xx        payload length, big-endian
//! { … }              that many bytes of JSON
//! ```
//!
//! # The trap
//!
//! The probe is nine bytes, and nine bytes is also exactly the length of an
//! HTTP/2 frame header. That is not a coincidence — it is what makes the two
//! cases distinguishable — but it means the nine bytes must be *pushed back*
//! when the magic does not match, or the HTTP/2 layer starts mid-header and
//! every frame after it is misparsed.
//!
//! # What the capture actually shows
//!
//! Headscale v0.29.3 does send one. The record lengths in
//! `tests/vectors/ts2021-session.pcap` are 21, 20, 111 — plaintexts of 5, 4 and
//! 95 bytes. So the magic, the length and the JSON each arrive in a *separate
//! record*, and the nine-byte probe spans three of them.
//!
//! That is the second trap, and it is why this is a reader with an internal
//! buffer rather than a function over one slice: the payload is framed in the
//! decrypted byte stream, and the record boundaries have nothing to do with it.
