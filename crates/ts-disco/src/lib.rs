//! Disco: finding a direct path to a peer.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! WireGuard needs to know where to send a packet, and on the internet that
//! answer changes: peers move, NATs rewrite ports, and neither side can be
//! told its own public address by anything except the other side. Disco is the
//! probe that discovers it — pings and pongs sent to every candidate address a
//! peer might be at, with the winner becoming the endpoint the tunnel uses.
//!
//! # It shares the WireGuard socket
//!
//! Disco messages travel on the same UDP socket as the tunnel, alongside
//! WireGuard's own packets, and are told apart by a six-byte magic prefix. That
//! is not an accident of implementation: a probe that arrived on a different
//! port would prove a path that the tunnel cannot use, because a NAT maps ports
//! independently.
//!
//! WireGuard's first byte is a message type in 1..=4, and disco's is `'T'`
//! (0x54), so the two cannot be confused. [`is_disco`] is the demultiplexer.
//!
//! # Different cryptography from everything else
//!
//! Disco uses NaCl's `crypto_box` — X25519 with HSalsa20 key derivation and
//! XSalsa20-Poly1305 — where the rest of the protocol uses ChaCha20-Poly1305.
//! It also uses the *disco* keypair, not the node key, so a disco message
//! cannot be replayed as anything else and a compromised disco key cannot
//! impersonate the node.
