//! [`ts_noise`] gets a node as far as an authenticated channel to the server.
//! This crate is what it says over it: registration now, and the map request as
//! the netmap parser arrives.
//!
//! Everything here is sans-io — documents in and out of caller-supplied buffers
//! — so the same code runs on the host, on the harness, and on the device.
