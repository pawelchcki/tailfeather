//! `MapRequest`: asking the server for the network map.
//!
//! # Compression, and why this crate omits the field
//!
//! Tailscale's map responses are normally zstd-compressed, and every zstd
//! decoder in Rust needs an allocator — `ruzstd` requires `alloc`
//! unconditionally — which would end the no-allocation property for the whole
//! project.
//!
//! Reading Headscale's `writeMap` shows it compresses only when the request
//! asked for it (`if m.req.Compress == util.ZstdCompression`), and writes the
//! four-byte length prefix either way. So a request that simply omits the field
//! should get plain JSON.
//!
//! "Should" is doing work in that sentence, which is why [`PATH`] has a
//! subcommand behind it in the harness: the question is answered by looking at
//! the bytes a real server sends, not by reading its source. Whether the *hosted*
//! service honours the same is a separate question and still open.
//!
//! # Framing
//!
//! Each response is `[4-byte length][JSON]`, and the length is **little-endian**
//! — unlike every other length in this protocol, which is big-endian. A
//! long-polling stream is many of these back to back.
