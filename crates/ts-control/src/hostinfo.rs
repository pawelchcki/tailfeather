//! What a node tells the control plane about itself.
//!
//! # How the field set was chosen
//!
//! Not from documentation. `tests/vectors/map_response.json` holds the
//! `Hostinfo` a real tailscaled 1.94.2 sent to a real Headscale, and the
//! conformance suite reads the field names out of that capture. This struct
//! carries the subset that is either load-bearing or honest to report:
//!
//! - `IPNVersion`, `OS`, `Hostname` — the server displays these, and an absent
//!   version makes a node look unsupported.
//! - `RoutableIPs` — how a node advertises itself as an exit node. This is the
//!   whole mechanism; there is no separate flag.
//! - `Services` — empty, but present, because the reference client sends it.
//!
//! Fields describing a Go runtime (`GoArch`, `GoVersion`, `Distro`) are omitted
//! rather than faked. A wrong value is worse than a missing one: it would be
//! displayed to a user as fact.
