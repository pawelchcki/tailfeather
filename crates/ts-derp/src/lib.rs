//! DERP: relaying for peers with no direct path.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Disco finds a direct path when one exists. Often none does — symmetric NATs,
//! restrictive firewalls, networks that drop UDP entirely — and then traffic has
//! to go through a server that both sides can reach. DERP is that server, and it
//! is deliberately dumb: it forwards WireGuard packets by destination *node key*
//! without being able to read any of them.
//!
//! It is also how two nodes bootstrap a direct path. `CallMeMaybe` travels over
//! the relay to tell a peer where to probe, which is a step that needs a working
//! path in order to establish a better one.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! An HTTP upgrade to `/derp`, then frames: `1B type ‖ 4B length BE ‖ payload`.
//! The server opens with its public key; the client answers with its own and a
//! sealed hello; after that, packets are addressed by node key.
//!
//! Note the length is **big-endian and four bytes**, where controlbase records
//! use two and map responses use four *little*-endian. Three framings in one
//! protocol, no two alike.
