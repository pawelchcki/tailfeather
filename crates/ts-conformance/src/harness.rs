//! Driving the `no_std` harness as a subprocess.
//!
//! # Why not link it
//!
//! Several checks could be answered by calling the library crates directly from
//! this `std` binary, and the vector-backed ones are. But a claim like "the node
//! completes a ts2021 handshake" is only worth something if it was made by a
//! binary with no libc, no `std` and no allocator — the environment the firmware
//! actually runs in. Linking the crates here would prove they work when `std` is
//! available to prop them up, which is not the question.
//!
//! So these checks run `harness/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-none/release/harness`
//! and read what it reports.
//!
//! # The event channel
//!
//! The harness prints human-readable progress and, separately, lines beginning
//! `#EVT ` carrying one JSON object each. Only the latter are parsed. That split
//! is the whole reason the checks are not brittle: the logging above can be
//! reworded freely, and only a deliberate change to an event breaks a check.
