//! # What this does and does not prove
//!
//! It links the `no_std` crate the firmware runs and puts it through the
//! scenario a mesh actually produces: many peers, all handshaking at once, each
//! then carrying traffic on its own keys. It catches the failures a single-peer
//! test cannot see — sessions attributed to the wrong peer, a device-wide rate
//! limit starving every peer but the first, one peer's rekey tearing down
//! another's session.
//!
//! What it cannot prove is protocol compatibility, because both sides of the
//! conversation are our code. That part is established separately and does
//! carry over: every message exchanged here is built by the same functions the
//! Linux kernel accepted in `scripts/interop-wireguard.sh`, in both roles. So
//! the construction is kernel-verified and the *multiplicity* is verified here.
//! The check reports it that way rather than claiming more.
