//! A compatibility suite measuring this project against real Tailscale and
//! Headscale.
//!
//! # Why it is shaped like this
//!
//! "100% compatible" is not something a test suite can prove. What it *can* do
//! is make the gap explicit, measurable, and impossible to lose track of. So
//! this suite is not a set of tests that pass or fail; it is an enumeration of
//! every behaviour a Tailscale-compatible node must exhibit, each carrying a
//! status. Behaviour that is not implemented yet is declared as
//! [`Status::Todo`] rather than omitted, so the score starts low and honestly.
//!
//! The second rule follows from experience on this project. The one protocol
//! bug that cost real time — WireGuard's Noise construction string — would have
//! passed any test written against our own understanding, because our
//! understanding was the thing that was wrong. It was caught by handing a
//! packet to the Linux kernel and watching it disagree. So every check here is
//! either run against a live reference implementation, or against bytes
//! captured from one. A check that only consults our own code is worth very
//! little, and is marked as such.
//!
//! # Statuses
//!
//! [`Status::Pass`] means this run verified the behaviour. [`Status::External`]
//! means a reference-backed artifact outside this process verified it — the
//! root-requiring interop scripts — and names it. Those two are the only ones
//! that count as compatible. [`Status::Todo`] is unbuilt work,
//! [`Status::Fail`] is a real defect, and [`Status::Skip`] means the check
//! could not run, which is never counted as success.
