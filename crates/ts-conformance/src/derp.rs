//! The DERP relay check.
//!
//! Two nodes connect to Headscale's embedded relay and one sends the other a
//! packet. Both endpoints are ours; the relay is not, and the relay is what is
//! under test. It decides whether the framing is valid, whether the sealed hello
//! proves we hold the node key we claim, and whether that key belongs to a node
//! it will carry traffic for — it turned an unregistered key away with
//! "admission controller: … not allowed", which is how that was learned.
//!
//! A relay that disagreed with any of it would simply never deliver.
